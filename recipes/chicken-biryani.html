        <h3>Steps to cook biryani</h3>

        <strong>Marinating the chicken:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and chopped coriander-mint leaves.</li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Cooking the Rice</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to boil in a large pot. Add soaked basmati rice, bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon sticks, and salt.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice until it's 70-80% done. Drain the water and set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <Strong>Preparing Fried Onion:</Strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil or ghee in a pan. Fry thinly sliced onions until golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Assembling and cooking the biryani:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed, oven-safe pot, add a layer of marinated chicken.</li>
            <li>Top the chicken with a layer of partially cooked rice.</li>
            <li>Continue layering, finishing with a layer of rice on top.</li>
            <li>Drizzle saffron-infused milk over the rice for color and aroma.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle fried onions over the rice.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil. Seal the edges to trap the steam.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork once it's cooked.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional fried onions and chopped coriander-mint leaves.</li>
        </ol>
